# SmartAlarmMOD
SmartAlarm Mod to Smartthings

This project is to show a indicator alarm mod to Smart Alarm from @Geko

You can add a indicator to show when the alarm is armed

The GE and Jesco switches have an indicator led ligth, I donÂ´t use that feature in switches, then I have give a better use to show when the alarm is armed.

I can see when alarm is armed just watching the led ligth in my room or in the front door or back door, is good way to verify if alarm is armed.

You can invert the led mode to turn on when is not armed and turn off when armed.

I hope this feature can be added to principal project from @geko
